# ObservationalDataAnalysis
This repo includes code for observational data analysis such as propensity score weighting, matching and more.

Propensity score weighting code was the first code that was added to the repository. Version 1 is now available for use. 
Version 2 should include updated output files (i.e. could we produce output in Word, would it be worthwhile to add one excel output file rather than many csv files?) and exploring the use of non-linear terms in the matching
